Manipal School of Information Sciences msis, a constituent unit of MAHE, Manipal, Udupi has active academic and research collaborations with many good foreign names partner universities. Study Abroad Programs (SAP) enabled our students to complete a portion of their academics at one of our international partner universities and earn two degrees.

SAPs were tailored to give students more options when it came to choosing their areas of study. SAP provided students with not only increased access to resources and professors, but also opportunities to work abroad and experience different cultures. SAP is less expensive than pursuing the two-degree programs separately. SAP programs have become extremely popular as a result of the numerous benefits they provide.
