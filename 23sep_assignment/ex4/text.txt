In computing, the term text processing refers to the theory and practice of automating the creation or manipulation of electronic text. 
Text usually refers to all the alphanumeric characters specified on the keyboard of the person engaging the practice, but in general text means the abstraction layer immediately above the standard character encoding of the target text. 

The term processing refers to automated (or mechanized) processing, as opposed to the same manipulation done manually.
